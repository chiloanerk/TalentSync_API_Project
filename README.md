# TalentSync Blogging Platform 
### Take home project introduction

This project aims to create a RESTful API for a blogging platform that supports user authentication, authorization, and basic blog post management functionalities.

1. It is created purely in PHP and the database is served by Mariadb SQL. 
   - To get started, edit the [config.php](config.php) file with your own database credentials.
   - run `composer install` to get the right dependencies
   - `php -S localhost:[YOUR_PORT]` to get the server running.
   - I use [httpie](https://httpie.io/), a cli package to send requests to the app.
